Work to do now: 

For users, start implementing delete user functionality 
Add functionality to change the ranks of users (swaps: top 0, bottom -1)
Test more to check if invalid input will be accepted for attendance 


I have added weekend check functionality, but I probably need to do 
something to make it more versatile (that is, select the days that you 
want). This will require a list of possible days 


Stuff left to do: 
0. Add functionality to join, quit, and leave groups. And to become admin or member
1. Add functionality to swap users' ranks, merge groups together 
2. Edit the attendance to get attendance of group and child groups 
3. Get the bot to ping the user every day.
