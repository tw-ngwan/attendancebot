Work to do now: 

ALL FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED!! 

I have added weekend check functionality, but I probably need to do 
something to make it more versatile (that is, select the days that you 
want). This will require a list of possible days 


Stuff left to do:
0. Change the help message, probably add a helpbasic. 
Also make function names easier 
0. Add encryption so that even if people have access, cannot use

Changed the keyboards, but check that you changed ALL keyboards 



Change the function names to become shorter
