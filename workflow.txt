Work to do now: 

For users, start implementing delete user functionality 
Add functionality to change the ranks of users (swaps: top 0, bottom -1)
Test more to check if invalid input will be accepted for attendance 


I have added weekend check functionality, but I probably need to do 
something to make it more versatile (that is, select the days that you 
want). This will require a list of possible days
