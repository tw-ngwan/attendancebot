Work to do now: 

For users, start implementing delete user functionality 
Add functionality to change the ranks of users (swaps: top 0, bottom -1)
Test more to check if invalid input will be accepted for attendance 

Currently, can only change current day's attendance. 
Add functions to change tmr's, and any other day's attendance. 
Add admin checks. You have the function already, but not implementing it!

Start implementing functionality to change attendance for any day. 

I just realized something. My update attendance inserts columns for every
update it does. There should be a check to see if the column already 
exists first. If not, then update.
