Work to do now: 

ALL FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED!! 

I have added weekend check functionality, but I probably need to do 
something to make it more versatile (that is, select the days that you 
want). This will require a list of possible days 


Stuff left to do: 
0. Edit the attendance to get attendance of group and child groups (done?)
1. Get a function to transfer users between groups (that are merged)
2. Get the bot to ping the user every day. 
3. Add encryption so that even if people have access, cannot use
